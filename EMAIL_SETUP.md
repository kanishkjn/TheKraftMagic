# Email Confirmation Setup Guide

Your website now automatically sends order confirmation emails to **buyers** at their registered email addresses when they complete an order.

## üéØ What's New
- ‚úÖ Confirmation emails are now sent to **buyers** instead of admin
- ‚úÖ Email addresses are retrieved from the customer's address information
- ‚úÖ Professional customer-focused email templates
- ‚úÖ Automatic validation to ensure email delivery

## How It Works

The system uses two methods to ensure email delivery:

### Method 1: EmailJS (Recommended)
- Professional email service integration
- Automatic email delivery to buyer's email
- Requires one-time setup
- More reliable and professional

### Method 2: Fallback (Automatic)
- Opens default email client with pre-filled confirmation details
- Works immediately without setup
- Requires manual sending
- Backup method if EmailJS fails

## üöÄ Setup Instructions for EmailJS (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create EmailJS Account
1. Go to [https://www.emailjs.com/](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Sign up for a free account
3. Verify your email address

### Step 2: Create Email Service
1. In EmailJS dashboard, go to **Email Services**
2. Click **Add New Service**
3. Choose your email provider (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
4. Follow the setup instructions for your provider
5. **Important**: Note down the **Service ID** (you'll need this later)

### Step 3: Create Email Template
1. Go to **Email Templates** in EmailJS dashboard
2. Click **Create New Template**
3. Use this template structure for buyer confirmation emails:

```html
Subject: Order Confirmation - {{order_number}} - The Kraft Magic

Dear {{customer_name}},

Thank you for your order with The Kraft Magic!

Order Details:
Order Number: {{order_number}}

4. **Important**: Note down the **Template ID**

### Step 4: Get Public Key
1. Go to **Account** > **API Keys**
2. Copy your **Public Key**

### Step 5: Update Configuration
1. Open `email-service.js` file in your project
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual IDs:

```javascript
const EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID = 'your_service_id_here';
const EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID = 'your_template_id_here'; 
const EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY = 'your_public_key_here';
```

### Step 6: Add EmailJS Script to HTML Files
Add this script tag to the `<head>` section of your HTML files that use email functionality:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@emailjs/browser@3/dist/email.min.js"></script>
```

**Files to update:**
- `confirmation.html` (already included)
- Any other pages that might trigger emails
